# Energy balance of thermoelectric cooler
by Dr. Guan Guoqiang @ SCUT
 * reproduce fig.2 in article results [1]
 * use junction temperature correction in the calculation of thermoelectric heat pump [2]
 * use empirical Nusselt correlation equation [3] to consider the temperature polarization
 * Use two TECs as the heat source and heat sink of DCMD operation
